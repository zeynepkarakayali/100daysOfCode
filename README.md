# 100daysOfCode
The repository where I publish my progress of the 100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu.

--------
## In this Program I am going to publish the "end of the day project"s outputs

--------
### Day 1. 
### Project Name: Band Name Generator
<br>
The goal of day 1 is to write a Band Name Generator.

The code of Day 1:
~~~
print("Hello! Welcome to the Band Name Generator! ")

color = input("Please write your favorite color. ")
animal = input("The animal you want to be the most? ")
zodiac = input("What is your zodiac sign? ")

print("The name of your band is: " + zodiac + " " + color + " " + animal)
~~~

--------
### Day 2. 
### Project Name: Tip Calculator
<br>
The goal of day 2 is to write a Tip Calculator.

The code of Day 2:
~~~
bill = float(input("What is your bill? "))
people = int(input("How many people will split the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("What is your tip percentage? "))
tip = (100 + percentage) / 100

pay = round((bill/people) * tip, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: {pay}")

road = input("Which way are you going to choose? Left or Right? ").lower()

if(road == "right"):

    print("You are lucky. You may pass.")

    print("Now you arrived at a dark grey pond.")
    swim = input('Are you going to "swim" or are you going to "wait?" ').lower()

    if(swim == "swim"):
        print("The piranhas attacked you. You died. Game Over.")
    else:
        print("A boat arrived! You crossed the lake unharmed.")
        door = input('You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose? ').lower()

### Day 6. 
### Project Name: Escaping the Maze
<br>
The goal of day 6 is to solve a challenge named Escaping the Maze.
In this day, we solved a bunch of coding challenges in 

[https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html]  and the last challenge was an escaping the maze coding challenge for our robot Reeborg.
<br> <br>

### Day 7. 
### Project Name: Hangman Game
<br>
The goal of day 7 is to write the Hangman Game.
In this day, we split the game step by step and solve them one by one.

The code of Day 7:
~~~
#Step 5
# HANGMAN GAME

import hangman_art
import hangman_words
import random

chosen_word = random.choice(hangman_words.word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

end_of_game = False
lives = 6

print(f"{hangman_art.logo}")
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

while not end_of_game:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    if guess in display:
        print("You already guessed this word. ")

    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

    if guess not in chosen_word:
        print(f"The letter {guess} is not in the word. ")
        lives -= 1
        if lives == 0:
            end_of_game = True
            print("You lose.")

    print(f"{' '.join(display)}")

    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")

    print(hangman_art.stages[lives])

### Day 8. 
### Project Name: Caesar's Cipher
<br>
The goal of day 8 is to write a Caesar's Cipher code.
In this day, we split the cipher code step by step and solve them one by one.

The code of Day 8:
~~~
from art import logo

alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

def caesar(start_text, shift_amount, cipher_direction):
  end_text = ""
  if cipher_direction == "decode":
    shift_amount *= -1
  for char in start_text:
    if char in alphabet:
        position = alphabet.index(char)
        new_position = position + shift_amount
        end_text += alphabet[new_position]
    else:
        end_text += char
    
  print(f"Here's the {cipher_direction}d result: {end_text}")

print(logo)

user = True
while user:
    if user:
        direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n")
        text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
        shift = int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))
        if(shift > 26):
           shift %= 26
        caesar(start_text=text, shift_amount=shift, cipher_direction=direction)
        var = input("Do you want to restart the program. Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'. ").lower()
        if(var == "yes"):
           user = True
        elif(var == "no"):
           user = False

### Day 9. 
### Project Name: Secret Auction
<br>
The goal of day 9 is to write a Secret Auction Program in code.

For this day the goal is normally to write a **secret** auction program that's why we should use the clear() function from replit but since I usually prefer to write my codes in [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I didn't use the function. That's why my auction turned out to be *not so secret* auction.

The code of Day 9:
~~~
from art import logo

def auction(bidders):

    highestBid = 0
    highestBidder = ""

    for bidder in bidders:
        if(bidders[bidder] > highestBid):
            highestBid = bidders[bidder]
            highestBidder = bidder
    print(f"The winner of the auction is: {highestBidder} with a bid of ${highestBid}")

bidders = {}
biddingFinished = False
while not biddingFinished:
    print("Welcome to the secret auction program. ")
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    bid = int(input("What is your bid? "))
    continuee = input("Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'. ").lower()
    bidders[name] = bid

    if continuee == "no":
        auction(bidders)
        biddingFinished = True
    elif continuee == "yes":
        auction(bidders)
