# 100daysOfCode
The repository where I publish my progress of the 100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu.

--------
## In this Program I am going to publish the "end of the day project"s outputs

--------
### Day 1. 
### Project Name: Band Name Generator
<br>
The goal of day 1 is to write a Band Name Generator.

The code of Day 1:
~~~
print("Hello! Welcome to the Band Name Generator! ")

color = input("Please write your favorite color. ")
animal = input("The animal you want to be the most? ")
zodiac = input("What is your zodiac sign? ")

print("The name of your band is: " + zodiac + " " + color + " " + animal)
~~~

--------
### Day 2. 
### Project Name: Tip Calculator
<br>
The goal of day 2 is to write a Tip Calculator.

The code of Day 2:
~~~
bill = float(input("What is your bill? "))
people = int(input("How many people will split the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("What is your tip percentage? "))
tip = (100 + percentage) / 100

pay = round((bill/people) * tip, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: {pay}")

### Day 3. 
### Project Name: Treasure Island Game
<br>
The goal of day 3 is to write a console Game called Treasure Island.

The code of Day 3:
~~~
print("Welcome to Treasure Island.")
print("Your mission is to find the treasure.")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("You are walking in an echanted forest and come into a cross road.")
road = input("Which way are you going to choose? Left or Right? ").lower()

if(road == "right"):
    print("The eagles attacked you. Game Over.")
elif(road == "left"):
    print("You are lucky. You may pass.")

    print("Now you arrived at a dark grey pond.")
    swim = input('Are you going to "swim" or are you going to "wait?" ').lower()

    if(swim == "swim"):
        print("The piranhas attacked you. You died. Game Over.")
    else:
        print("A boat arrived! You crossed the lake unharmed.")
        door = input('You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose? ').lower()

        if(door == "yellow"):
            print("YOU WON THE GAME!!!")
        else:
            print("You lost try again. :(")

else:
    print("There are no roads like that.")
