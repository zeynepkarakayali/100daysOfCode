bill = float(input("What is your bill? "))
people = int(input("How many people will split the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("What is your tip percentage? "))
tip = (100 + percentage) / 100

pay = round((bill/people) * tip, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: {pay}")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("You are walking in an echanted forest and come into a cross road.")
road = input("Which way are you going to choose? Left or Right? ").lower()

if(road == "right"):
    print("The eagles attacked you. Game Over.")
elif(road == "left"):
    print("You are lucky. You may pass.")

    print("Now you arrived at a dark grey pond.")
    swim = input('Are you going to "swim" or are you going to "wait?" ').lower()

    if(swim == "swim"):
        print("The piranhas attacked you. You died. Game Over.")
    else:
        print("A boat arrived! You crossed the lake unharmed.")
        door = input('You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose? ').lower()

        if(door == "yellow"):
            print("YOU WON THE GAME!!!")
        else:
            print("You lost try again. :(")
